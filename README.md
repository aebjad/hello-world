Cloud Engineer with AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner with over a decade of experience in IT, specializing in cloud solutions and full-stack Java development. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create efficient, scalable solutions that drive innovation.
In my most recent role as an Associate Software Engineer at Optum, I successfully migrated applications to enhance deployment efficiency and developed REST APIs with Spring Boot and Java. 
I also have a solid foundation in networking, with CCNA certification and hands-on experience managing and resolving network incidents, which has sharpened my troubleshooting skills and improved response times.
I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to continuous learning, currently expanding my cloud expertise through training in AWS at Per Scholas. I’m skilled in various technologies, including Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and Agile methodologies, and I’m eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities in cloud technology.
